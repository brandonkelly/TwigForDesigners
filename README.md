# Twig for Designers

[Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) is a fast and powerful templating system, written for PHP-based applications. It’s already being used in a ton of apps including our own CMS, [Craft](http://buildwithcraft.com), and we expect it to continue gaining in popularity for some time to come.

The system is well thought-out and a joy to work with – once you’ve learned it. The only problem is, its [documentation](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html) is geared toward developers, often leaving non-developers in the dust when introducing key concepts and features.

We’ve been talking with several designers over the past year, learning what the pain points are and how to explain them. With this book, my goal is that designers will have a new, definitive place to learn Twig, without making any assumptions about prior programming experience.


After reading it, you should:

- Understand the different aspects of Twig’s templating syntax
- Be familiar with the different techniques Twig offers for keeping templates DRY
- Know where to go to find out more

To get started, please visit the [Table of Contents](toc.md).

## It’s a work in progress

It’s going to take a lot of work to fully complete this book. Rather than keep the whole thing to myself until it’s done, I’ve decided to share my progress as I go, in case anyone finds what I’ve already written useful.

The book will loosely follow the outline of a workshop I gave at [Peers 2014](http://peersconf.com/2014/). Caroline Blaker was kind enough to publish some notes she took during the workshop, so if you want to get a sneak peak for what’s to come, [check those out](https://github.com/carolinecblaker/twig-notes/blob/master/notes "Notes on Brandon Kelly’s Twig workshop at Peers 2014").

I will be tweeting when new pages are added from [@brandonkelly](http://twitter.com/brandonkelly).

## Additional resources

Here are some resources that many have found helpful when learning Twig for Craft:

- [Templating in EE vs. Craft](https://gist.github.com/brandonkelly/8584132) – lots of examples comparing templating in ExpressionEngine to Craft (Twig).
- [Twig Templating on Straight up Craft](http://straightupcraft.com/twig-templating) – curated list of resources for learning Twig in Craft.
